# Binary-Classification-using-CNN

## Problem Question
> Create A Binary classifier which categorizes input images as Cats or Dogs

## Dataset
Dataset can be downloaded from this link:
[Cat-Dog-Dat](https://jxjjxy-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/hmai9bp5t_t_odmail_cn/EQvCF6r6EzBEhYmB9oPFu24BEE8gibHqoP0v_Tf8YNgGEA?e=PBtRdD)

The dataset provided consists of training data and testing data for both the categories. 

## Solution

* This code realizes a CNN for binary classification using tensorflow backened keras.
* The accuracy obtained was around 82%, and it was the only metric score considered. 
* The algorithm was trained on well classified and labelled image data consisting of 10,000 images.

PS- Change the directory used in the code before running
