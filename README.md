# Binary-Classification-using-CNN

## Problem Question
> Create A Binary classifier which categorizes input images as Cats or Dogs

## Dataset
The dataset provided consists of training data and testing data for both the categories. 

## Solution

* This code realizes a CNN for binary classification using tensorflow backened keras.
* The accuracy obtained was around 82%, and it was the only metric score considered. 
* The algorithm was trained on well classified and labelled image data consisting of 10,000 images.

PS- Change the directory used in the code before running

**To use pictures of your own, input the new directory in the code**
