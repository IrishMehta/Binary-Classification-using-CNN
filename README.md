# Binary-Classification-using-CNN
Using a convolutional neural network to categorize images of cats and dogs.
This code realizes a CNN for binary classification using tensorflow backened keras.
The accuracy obtained was around 82%, and it was the only metric score considered. 
The algorithm was trained on well classified and labelled image data consisting of 10,000 images.
